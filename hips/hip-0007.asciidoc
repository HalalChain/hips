## Abstract
The naming rules of development interface (API/RPC) is case-sensitive, but some method name are likely to lead to ambiguity, it is inconvenient to us. so case-insensitive naming rules is a better way. We can change RPC Server router to do that. 

## Motivation
The current usage for the Qitmeer api, E.g "getBlockhash" is correct,but "getBlockHash" is wrong,even though they are the same meaning. In accordance with the principle of case-sensitive,"getBlockHash" Should be correct,so this is ambiguity.
```sh
#getBlockhash
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-type':'application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc": "1.0","method": "getBlockhash","params": [2],"id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8081

#getBlockHash
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-type':'application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc": "1.0","method": "getBlockHash","params": [2],"id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8081
```


## Specification
All apis are not case sensitive. E.g 'submitblock','submitBlock','SubmitBlock'...all of them are correct.


## Backwards Compatibility
The original case distinction is strict url verification, now it is loose verification, so there is no compatibility issue.
