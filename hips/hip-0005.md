## Abstract
Block DAG would inevitably avoid duplicated transactions in blocks. If block DAG is linearly ordered, such as PHANTOM protocol, we could store the full transactions in blocks if they never appear in former blocks whereas we store only the transaction IDs if they appear.

## Motivation
In block DAG paradigm, blocks are generated in parallel, so it is invetibly avoid transaction collisions, which would reduce the storage efficiency. The throuput of Block DAG is high in general and it makes ledger storage intensive, therefore storage efficiency becomes particulaly important.

## Specification
### Notation
- $tx$: transaction
- $B$:  block
- $pre(B)$: blocks prior to block B in the linear order. Note this is diffferent than ancestors, ancestors are prior to B in topological partial order whereas $pre(B)$ may not have.

### Definition
TODO

## Backwards Compatibility
 This proposal is dependent on that blocks are linearly ordered, so pairwised ordered DAG protocol such as SPECTRE may not work.
