## Abstract
Now the nox block length is 124,the type of the time is uint32,we increase the length of the time,from uint32 to uint64.

## Motivation
Because the opencl miner of the algorithm of blake2b needs the length of (header data)is Multiple of 8, if do this , the opencl has the best performance.

The other reason the original author want the type of time is int64.

## Specification
This just effect the core block length.

## Backwards Compatibility
This is the core block change in private network ,so it will need remove the old block data. In the future it will be Tend to be stable.
    

## Use Cases
It run will in the private network,when mining new block,it don't occur any exceptions.

## Implementation
see https://git.diabin.com/HLC/nox/pulls/8

## Test Cases

In the git mining-dev repo,can test.
