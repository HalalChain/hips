## Abstract
Define the naming of Block DAG in the HalalChain

## Motivation
In order to respond to the call of the times and facilitate the wide dissemination and exchange of Block DAG  in the HalalChain, we need to define a distinctive name for it.

## Specification
### Block DAG
|===
| ID | Name | Reason | Score | State
| 1 | Solar | Solar System | 1 | Draft
| 2 | Apollo | Sun god | 1 | Draft
|===

## Implementation
The most important technology used in our Block DAG is DAG algorithm, and we all know that DAG is a directed acyclic graph.

But if you add a timeline and look at it from the perspective of the main chain, it might look like this.

You'll find that all the blocks move around the main chain. And I remember when we were young in geography class, the teacher told us that eight planets in the solar system run around the sun. Notice that interesting things will happen, if you think about the real trajectory of the entire solar system. Did you find that they are very similar?
