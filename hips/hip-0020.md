## Abstract
Block DAG would inevitably avoid duplicated transactions in blocks. This prosposal proposes a compact storage mechanism for block DAG ledger, so the ledger only needs to store one full  transaction for the earliest incorporating block and a bunch of transaction IDs for the rest. This mechainsm requires that transactions are linely ordered, so in HLC case, it works with PHANTOM protocol.  

## Motivation
In block DAG paradigm, blocks are generated in parallel, so it is invetibly avoid transaction collisions, which would reduce the storage efficiency. The throughput of Block DAG is high in general and it makes ledger storage intensive, therefore storage efficiency becomes particulaly important.

## Specification

### Intuition
 A transaction is stored in multiple blocks with high probability, but there is no need for all these blocks to save a full copy, which causes high storage inefficiency.  The reasonable solution is only one block saves just one copy of full transaction and make the other blocks with the same transaction incorporated store only transaction IDs, which will greatly save storage space. 

### Algorithm

```basic
Function:  OnSecureConfirmed 
Input: newBlock - secure confirmed block, L - ledger
Output:  L - compacted ledger

newOrder ← getOrder(newBlock)
if newOrder = ϕ then
    throw "newBlock is not secure confirmed"
    return L
for all tx ϵ L do
    oldBlock ← tx2block[tx]
    oldOrder ← getOrder(oldBlock)
    if oldOrder ≺ newOrder then
        L.replaceTxWithID(newBlock, tx)
    else
        L.replaceTxWithID(oldBlock, tx)
        tx2Block[tx] = newBlock
return L
```
