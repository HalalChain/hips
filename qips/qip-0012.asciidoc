# Abstract

When the QIT main network goes online, the old QIT (erc20  token) will cease to be used and the holder will obtain the QIT on the main network through the map of the main network.

# Motivation

complete erc20 QIT -> QIT mainet transformation;

# Specification

Destroy: send erc20 QIT to the ***black hole address***;

Mapping: monitor the address of the black hole on the main chain, issue mainet QIT to the mapping address according to the budget ratio after receiving erc20 QIT;

# Implementation

### 1. Record the mapped address in the smart contract;

create solidity smart contract:

    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
    contract AddressMapping { 
        mapping(address => bytes) balances;
        function addAddress( bytes QITMainAdd ) {
            require( balances[msg.sender].length == 0, 'One address can only correspond to one map');
            balances[msg.sender] = QITMainAdd;
        }
        function getHCLaddress( address _owner ) view returns( bytes ) {
            return balances[_owner];
        }
    }

### 2. Call addAddress to add the mapping address;

    0x14723a09acff6d2a60dcdf7aa4aff308fddc160c -> 0x44d959afb6db4ad730a6e2c0daf46ceeb98c53a0
    // ETH -> QIT publickeyhash
    0x14723a09acff6d2a60dcdf7aa4aff308fddc160c -> RmCYoUMqKZopUkai2YhUFHR9UeqjeyjTAgW

### 3. Erc20 QIT send to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`;


    MyContract.methods.transfer(
    '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    10000000
    ).send()

### 4. Oracle listens to the transfer

After listening to the transfer, query the mapped address through the AddressMapping contract, and transfer QIT main to the mapped address according to the specified proportion to complete the token exchange.
