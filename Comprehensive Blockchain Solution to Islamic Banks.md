## About the Islamic Bank
   
   This part is kept to desribe the detailed information about the background of any Islamic banks subject to different situation.
    
## About HalalChain
HLC (HalalChain) is the first public blockchain company that focuses on serving Muslim countries and regions.
## Overview of proppsal
HLC public chain is built on the new distributed ledger Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This
underlying technology achieves “High Throughput” with high security and fully decentralized
guarantee. By combining the advanced DAG technology with unique application scenarios
whereby HLC technology is able to build across the multi-layer payment system within the
Islamic economy ecosystem. However, Blockchain reduces the trust costs among multiple
parties - no one needs to trust another party or through an intermediary. Base on the HLC market
research and Blockchain stakeholders there are some challenges facing Blockchain industry in
both practical and technology perspectives, which keep Blockchain into practical business
scenarios. These challenges are analysed and discuss in the following details:
### Scalability
When a blockchain is deemed scalable, it means that it could provide sufficient services as the
demands grow. There seems to be a contradiction between scalability and security, to be more
specific, decentralization. Bitcoin and Ethereum are fully decentralized Blockchain in theory,
actually not due to mining pool though, but they could only process theoretically seven and
fifteen transactions per second, which are far behind the expectation as a payment network.
Ripple and Stellar claim thousands of transactions per second capability, however, they are
generally considered as permissioned blockchains and rather centralized, that is to say, we need
to trust block producers, which is a too stringent setting in various scenarios. Decentralization
is the source of trust on Blockchain. otherwise it could highly likely involve the risk of the
Denial-of-Service attack and collusions in the network — which seriously undermine trust. 
### Interoperability
There is no single project to rule the blockchain world. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different 
protocols, even though there are solutions that could make them communicate with each other,
they could not undertake such big amount of transactions and services perse, that is the reason
why, protocols are designed to live with its own ecosystem. Therefore, if different Islamic
Financial Institutions adopt different protocols like Ethereum, Stellar, and Bitcoin, it will be
very difficult to communicate with each other (and so prevent scalability) as well as increasing
their costs on adoption of this technology. In addition, these protocols are not taking into
consideration Shariah compliance of their protocol. So, our goal is a blockchain born with
embracing other blockchain ecosystems, which is naturally Shariah ocmpliant, scalable and
easy to be interacted with.
### Compliance Concern
Within the ecosystem of existing blockchain protocols, some of its D-Apps are about gambling,
on-line lottery...etc. Which are not compliant nor in line with Islamic values. In light of above,
there are significant demands for expansion of the global Islamic economy ecosystem to include
a public chain that gives consideration to Shariah rules and principles from its foundational
layer, plus its tokenization layer, its payment payer, as well as the whole ecosystem
## HLC Solution to this industry issues
HLC (HalalChain) is the first blockchain to serve Islamic economy and finance, built by Islamic
finance experts as well as experience blockchain developers and blockchain industry
stakeholders. Therefore, HLC has solved these challenges base on the following analysis:
### BLOCK DAG Solved Salability
Block DAG is probability the only Scalability solution so far to comply with the classic
blockchain setting, i.e., fully decentralized, 50% fault tolerance, high throughput. When the
throughput is high, there will be multiple blocks created in parallel, according to longest-chain
rule consensus as most blockchain networks do, competing blocks will increase probability of
forks and cause security issues. On the other hand, Block DAG is using heaviest-chain rule
consensus to embrace those forks while keeping the same security as bitcoin - 50% fault tolerance.
### Born with Interoperability
One of the HLC core code is to embrace various ecosystems and help their values flow among
each other. So, HLC has investigated the state-of-art interoperability solutions, such as
PolkaDot and Cosmos, dedicated to providing a best practice to integrate mainstream
blockchain worlds, like bitcoin and Ethereum.
### Shariah Consideration in the whole Ecosystem
The most HLC innovative contribution to Islamic finance is the tokenization mechanism. Other
than assets issuance platform without any regulation, HLC engages blockchain stakeholders to
hold a special token called licenses to issue their assets or tokens. These licenses will be
distributed and supervised by authorized Islamic finance experts and all the distributions can
be recorded and tracked on the blockchain, so it is unlikely for a license to be distributed to a
wrong hand through community consensus. This assures that transactions can be Shariah
compliant as well as adhere to AML and anti-fraud best practices.
## Proposed Pilot Use cases
The Islamic economy’s full potential could be fully unleashed through blockchain, which could
enhance the stability, security and public participation of the new financial landscape in modern
era. The ultimate approach is to activate global Islamic assets and attract liquidity through the
organic combination of Islamic economy and blockchain which could be illustrated in form of
applicable use cases on the HLC public chain.
### Smart Sukuk
The main industry trend in the blockchain and Islamic Economy is to set up the relationship
mapping between physical asset and Crypto-asset, which gives Islamic finance an opportunity
to act as the global platform for Islamic Asset tokenization. Such platform (HLC platform)
would attract trillions of dollars in the size of assets to be tokenized through blockchain.
Smart Sukuk is a tokenization by collecting funds from investors in exchange for Sukuk Tokens
which representing an ownership portion of the Sukuk investment. When the institutions (SPE)
makes payments, the funds are automatically distributed back to the Sukuk Token holders via
the blockchain according to the rules of the smart contract in Islamic Economics - without the
need of intermediaries.
Smart Sukuk based on blockchain, would solve the bottlenecks in the course of Issuance,
subscription, operation, governance, regulation and circulation in the industry. A tokenized,
divisible, and tradable Sukuk asset could provide access to liquidity pool from the public as
well as the global crypto-market. 
### Stable Coin
Stable coins: is core product which is Shariah compliant smart contract that represents an equity
stake in Sukuk portfolio, which successfully combines traditional Islamic finance principles
with those of mainstream finance.
Stable Coin is a token whose smart contract represents the owners’ share in a financial fund (or
SPV) formed by investment grade Sukuk. When consumers purchase the token, they are buying
into a fund of diversified Sukuk of high quality and high liquidity Sukuk
##Summary and Way forward
This part is kept to write detailed solutions according to different banks.
