## The Background
Debt financing forms the pipeline through which liquidity flows into global capital markets. 
Throughout history, corporations and governments have issued bonds to raise funds for various endeavors, providing volatility averted investors with stable annual coupon yields.
Yet until very recently, financial institutions and investors in the Islamic world did not have access to this. 
With the development of the Sukuk at the end of the 20th century, Islamic investors gained the ability to receive annuities derived from profits generated by an underlying asset.
Since its inception in 2001, the demand for Sukuk bonds has risen significantly. According the IFSB, the Sukuk is defined as" Certificate
that represents the holder's proportionate ownership in an undivided part of an underlying asset where holder assumes all rights and obligations to such asset".
